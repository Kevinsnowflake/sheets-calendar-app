See how Cortex Code scans source tables, generates models, adds tests, runs builds, validates outputs, and produces a shareable report, all from your terminal. What used to take hours of context-switching across tools now takes minutes.",
Optimizing dbt for speed and cost,Uche Nkadi,Editing in progress,DE,CLI,Q1 Coco + DE Use Cases Video Briefs,3_dbt_201,,,,,Optimize dbt Projects for Speed,Optimize dbt Projects for Speed With Cortex Code,"dbt projects are easy to build, but keeping them fast and cost-efficient is another challenge. As source tables grow and models become more complex, runtimes increase and performance issues get harder to pinpoint.

In this demo, Cortex Code CLI analyzes your project’s run_results.json, identifies the slowest models, flags unused ones, and suggests specific optimizations you can apply immediately, all from a single prompt in your terminal.",
Airflow - Debugging a failed DAG run ,Jacob Prall,Editing in progress,DE,CLI,Q1 Coco + DE Use Cases Video Briefs,4_Airflow,,Draft Link (https://next.frame.io/share/d66ead16-e33d-4a41-89e4-71a74ed1f0d3/view/92bd849e-a4b6-45c0-a4dd-109b8b890558),,,Debug Apache Airflow® DAGs,Debug Apache Airflow® DAG Failures With Snowflake Cortex Code,"Learn how Cortex Code CLI helps you debug a failed Airflow DAG run end to end, from task status to dbt logs and Snowflake validation. See how a single prompt traces a failed dbt model, inspects the model SQL, checks upstream dependencies in Snowflake, and identifies the root cause, a broken source table. 

This workflow fits Airflow running locally, on Kubernetes, or on MWAA, and supports follow-up prompts for data quality checks and downstream impact analysis.",
